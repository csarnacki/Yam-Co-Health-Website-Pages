# Yam-Co-Health-Website-Pages

This is my second project site I have created. It was finalized in the spring of 2021 and mainly contains HTML and CSS with a small section of JavaScript included. There are three separate forms used in the site. There is one that contains the code for the search bar at the top of the page, there is one for finding a preferred doctor and there is one for creating the services offered by each clinic location.

The CSS was used to style the font, the layout, the header and footer, the forms themselves along with the sign up/log in pop up. The JavaScript is used to create the modal that forms the sign up/log in pop up. 

There are a few external links included in the site and the main heading of the site also acts as a link to the homepage.

Just with the first project site I made, there are currently no plans to update this site as I want to continue to use it for examples in future projects as well as look back at my code and see what I can change.
